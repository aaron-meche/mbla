            Hello, you must have found this website by specifically navigating to this URL. I am a local resident of Moss Bluff, LA and am interested in improving the local community in any way that I can. This is why I have bought this domain with the intention of developing a website for my local community. Planned features include an interactive map of Moss Bluff, GIS data, index of local businesses and government offices, a bulletin board of local events, and much more! This website will be independently developed by one single individual (me) and not associated with any other entities or individuals. If you are curious about the development of this site and want to view the source code on GitHub, you can visit the repository <a href="https://github.com/aaron-meche/mbla" target="_blank">here</a>. Alternatively, you can visit my GitHub profile by clicking <a href="https://github.com/aaron-meche/" target="_blank">here</a>. Thanks for visiting, and I hope to see you again soon when this site is futher developed.
